Little Red Riding Hood needs to find the fastest path to Grandma's house. 
The Big Bad Wolf will approach her on her way though, and the only way to
speed up these encounters is to give away some of your sweets.
Find the fastest path while still having at least one candy for Grandma!

This application uses A Star path finding algorithm as well as Genetic Algorithm (in AI context)
to find the cheapest path across the given map.
